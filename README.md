# Code challenge!

## Create a simple page using the Random User API.

* The app/page should have a Master/Detail flow in which at least 50 profile image thumbnails are
shown on a grid on a “home” screen. The list must show:

 Small picture
 Full name
 City
 Country

* When users tap on a thumbnail on the grid, they’re taken into a new screen in which the large image
is shown on the top of the screen, and some basic user data is listed below: username, first name, last
name, and email address, etc (see the API results).

Here is the API documentation: https://randomuser.me/documentation

## Some tips:

* You can implement some kind of pagination or “infinite scroll” on the grid but it’s not mandatory.

* If you have some extra time or you just want to show off, you can add some bells and whistles to your
app: responsive design, transition animations, visual response, and so on.

## About the technology to use:

 You must use HTML, CSS and Java Script.
 You must use one of the following java script framework/libraries Angular, VUE, React. (do not
use Vainilla and JQuery)
 The page/app should be easily accessible (local server, or uploaded somewhere)
 Upload your code to a repo so we can review it once you finish.
